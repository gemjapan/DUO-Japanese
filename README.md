# DUO Japanese

The [Data Use Ontology (DUO)](https://github.com/EBISPOT/DUO) is a suite of technical standards for sharing genomic and health related data developed and approved by the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)](https://www.ga4gh.org/).

Every institution uses unique language in their informed consent forms to describe the secondary use restrictions and conditions on their datasets. This means that each data access request must be manually evaluated against the data use letter that specifies how the dataset can be used. Consequently, Data Access Committees typically respond to such requests in two to six weeks, considerably slowing down the pace of research.

Developed by the GA4GH Data Use and Researcher Identities (DURI) Work Stream to address this challenge, DUO allows to semantically tag datasets with restriction about their usage, making them discoverable automatically based on the authorization level of users, or intended usage.

To use the DUO in Japan, [GEM Japan DURI workstream group](https://github.com/gemjapan/DURI) localized the DUO codes of release 2020-02-03 into Japanese. The localized DUO code will be incorporated as a Japanese label of each corresponding class in DUO.  Note that this is the first attempt of multilingualization of DUO codes.
